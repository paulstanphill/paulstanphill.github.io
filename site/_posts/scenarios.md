> High school Photography Student

Darren loves photography. Sadly, his disctrict recently lost funding for the arts and the photography teacher was fired and the school got rid of the film development room, which really sucks since his school was the last in the state to have a film photography program. Now he works for the yearbook with amateur DSLRs, but wishes he had a specific project to work on for him to learn and adapt to screen viewfinders, customizing the button mapping to his liking to feel more in control, more like the camera is an extension of himself so he can focus on the moment when taking a picture.

While gaming online, a friend from another state tells him about this "high school hack-a-thon" going on that is free to participate in and can maybe get some college credit while only engaging in the parts of the project you want.

Checking out the website, he finds a poster in the "Student Resources" portion of the site that can be printed on a page of 11" x 17" (~A3) paper and posted in school or emailed as an attachment to your teacher / mentor describing the project and the Educator role benefits. Browsing further, Darren also finds the Community College Recruitment email template to send to the Registrar and / or High School Dual Enrollment.
