## Unorganized thoughts

I'm going to be adding junk all over this site, and it probably won't be the prettiest or most organized. That said, I have found I do not make progress when I am acting like too much of a perfectionist, so yeah.

That hurt to write. Every time I read it I get a little naseous. It stays.

### Monetization
I've also had ideas for money making ideas bouncing around in my head for years. I'm going to be sharing some here. Ideally, I'll find investors or someone who likes it and offers me a bundle to develop the full framework I've come up with so far and then share. Anything with residual income is welcome as well. If I could just get enough free time to pursue new projects, I know I could get so much done. It is working full time, trying to spend time with my dog and partner, get out into nature, engage with therapy to keep making progress... it is hard to keep making progress with these schemes, strategems, and pursuits.

So now I'm going to write down the tl;dr version of many of these ideas, and invite any and all to contact me for further discussion.

## Hey, Screw You Too Buddy!

I owe you nothing. This project is for myself. I'm making it public to try and place *some* level of external pressure on myself. If everyone can see how often I do or don't work on it, well, maybe that can be an additional motivation in itself. That said, I'm also going to be sharing things about me, hopes and dreams, art I hope to sell, who knows what else. That includes me. I have an idea, but no solid framework. I have too many ideas, so we'll see what prioritizes itself in my brain and actually makes it to screen.

If you don't like anything here, feel free to let me know. Perhaps we can have a productive discussion that gives me a new perspective, and leads me to edit my site and my vocabulary or behavior. Or, you know, blast it on a site instead, take me out of context, and turn me into a public figure overnight so people can hate me for being ~~too~~ ~~not enough~~ ~~loud~~ ~~shut up~~ ~~what does a redhead know anyway~~ ~~who are you to talk about this~~ ~~you haven't mentiond this yet~~ on, and on as per the standard now.

### Get involved

Want to learn to code, but don't have project ideas? I'm overflowing. Already an experienced developer, perhaps working with me professionally elsewhere, and stumbled across this? Get in touch if you want to give me a piece of advice on approach. I've been thinking about spreading projects across dev platforms, such as creating a companion .RMD site hosted on RStudio to develop a specific project. Maybe mentoring me in data science, as I have an incredibly specific use case for either R/Python/??? I'd like to use to learn some basic data science knowledge.
